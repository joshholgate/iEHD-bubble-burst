# iEHD-bubble-burst
Just a dump of codes and data from bubble bursting simulations. Code is idential to iEHD but with the option to use the level-set function of a bubble erupting from a liquid surface in place of a small cylindrical perturbation. As always, any comments and complaints should be addressed to j.holgate14@imperial.ac.uk.
